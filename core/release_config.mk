# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Choose the flag files
# -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Release configs are defined in reflease_config_map files, which map
# the short name (e.g. -next) used in lunch to the starlark files
# defining the build flag values.
#
# (If you're thinking about aconfig flags, there is one build flag,
# RELEASE_ACONFIG_VALUE_SETS, that sets which aconfig_value_set
# module to use to set the aconfig flag values.)
#
# The short release config names *can* appear multiple times, to allow
# for AOSP and vendor specific flags under the same name, but the
# individual flag values must appear in exactly one config.  Vendor
# does not override AOSP, or anything like that.  This is because
# vendor code usually includes prebuilts, and having vendor compile
# with different flags from AOSP increases the likelihood of flag
# mismatch.

# Do this first, because we're going to unset TARGET_RELEASE before
# including anyone, so they don't start making conditionals based on it.
# This logic is in make because starlark doesn't understand optional
# vendor files.

# If this is a google source tree, restrict it to only the one file
# which has OWNERS control.  If it isn't let others define their own.
# TODO: Remove wildcard for build/release one when all branch manifests
# have updated.
